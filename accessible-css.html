            <h2>Our Goals for 2030</h2>
            <p>We’re racing to hit these targets to help the world reverse climate change and biodiversity loss. Together, we find the paths to make change possible.</p>
            <h3>3B</h3>
            <p>Avoid or sequester 3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually—the same as taking 650 million cars off the road every year.</p>
            <h3>4B</h3>
            <p>Conserve 4 billion hectares of marine habitat—more than 10% of the world’s oceans—through protected areas, sustainable fishing and more.</p>
            <h3>100M</h3>
            <p>Help 100 million people at severe risk of climate-related emergencies by safeguarding habitats that protect communities.</p>
            <h3>30M</h3>
            <p>Conserve 1 million kilometers of rivers—enough to stretch 25 times around the globe—plus 30 million hectares of lakes and wetlands.</p>
            <h3>650M</h3>
            <p>Conserve 650 million hectares—a land area twice the size of India—of biodiverse habitats such as forests, grasslands and desert.</p>
            <h3>45M</h3>
            <p>Support the leadership of 45 million people from Indigenous and local communities in stewarding their environment and securing rights.</p>
